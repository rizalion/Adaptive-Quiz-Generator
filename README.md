🧠 Adaptive Quiz Generator
This is my final project for the Artificial Intelligence course, built using Python. The Adaptive Quiz Generator dynamically generates quizzes based on student performance, difficulty levels, and learning progress.

🚀 Features
📊 Adaptive Difficulty: Questions adapt in real-time based on user responses.
🧩 Constraint Satisfaction & Clustering: Used for intelligent question selection.
🧠 Knowledge Representation: Tracks what the user knows and identifies gaps.
💾 CSV-based question loading for flexibility and easy editing.
🎯 Performance Tracking and personalized feedback.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn (for clustering)
Custom logic for constraint satisfaction & knowledge representation
